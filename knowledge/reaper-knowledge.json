          "topic": "Gain Staging",
          "content": "Proper gain staging in REAPER: Aim for -18dBFS to -12dBFS on individual tracks for optimal headroom. Use the track trim/gain before the fader for initial level setting. Keep the master fader at 0dB and adjust individual tracks instead. Watch for red meters indicating clipping.",

          "topic": "EQ Basics",
          "content": "EQ tips for mixing: Cut before boost - remove unwanted frequencies before adding. High-pass filter vocals around 80-100Hz to remove rumble. Cut muddy frequencies around 200-400Hz. Boost presence in vocals around 3-5kHz. Use narrow Q for cutting, wide Q for boosting.",

          "topic": "Compression",
          "content": "Compression settings guide: For vocals use 3:1 to 4:1 ratio, medium attack (10-30ms), medium release. For drums use faster attack, 4:1 to 8:1 ratio. For bass use slower attack to preserve transients. Aim for 3-6dB of gain reduction on most sources.",
