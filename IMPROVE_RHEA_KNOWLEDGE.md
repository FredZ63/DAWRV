# 🧠 Improving RHEA's Knowledge

## What's Been Created

I've created a comprehensive knowledge base for RHEA covering:

### 📚 Knowledge Files

| File | Contents | Size |
|------|----------|------|
| `reaper-complete-guide.md` | Full REAPER reference (interface, recording, MIDI, editing, mixing, plugins, shortcuts, actions) | ~15,000 words |
| `music-production-knowledge.md` | DAW concepts, EQ, compression, reverb, delay, mixing, MIDI, genres, common mistakes | ~10,000 words |
| `rhea-personality-guide.md` | Natural speaking patterns, response examples, emotional intelligence, studio slang | ~5,000 words |

**Location:** `ai-training/knowledge-base/`

## Testing RHEA's New Knowledge

After importing, try these questions:

### Basic Knowledge
- "What's the difference between VST and AU plugins?"
- "How do I set up punch recording?"
- "What frequency range is the bass guitar?"

### Practical Help
- "My mix sounds muddy, what should I do?"
- "What compressor settings for vocals?"
- "How do I quantize MIDI in REAPER?"

### Natural Conversation
- "Let's hear what we got" (should understand = play)
- "Kill track 3" (should understand = mute)
- "Roll tape" (should understand = record)

### Troubleshooting
- "I'm getting crackling sounds"
- "The reverb sounds too washy"
- "My kick and bass are clashing"

## Technical Notes

### How the Knowledge Base Works
1. **Chunking** - Text is split into ~500 word chunks
2. **Embedding** - Each chunk gets a vector representation
3. **Storage** - Stored locally in browser (IndexedDB)
4. **Retrieval** - When you ask a question, relevant chunks are found
5. **Context** - Retrieved chunks are added to the AI's context

### Keeping Knowledge Fresh
- Knowledge persists across sessions
- Export regularly as backup
- Clear and re-import if needed
- Add new knowledge as you learn
